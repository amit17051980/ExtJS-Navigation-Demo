This test code demonstrates the ability of ExtJS 4 to load a variety of widgets with different configurations and dynamic stores, and rearrange them inside a layout to 10 presets. 

I have included two tables for reference. The first is a quick chart of the x/y coordinates that widgets can be positioned in, and the second is a chart of widget ID's and their corresponding titles.
